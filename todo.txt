The following just for any other language as well:
  - <leader>g is too specific - use a language-agnostic keymap!

Fugitive:
  - interactive stage/unstage (how about hunks - gitgutter helps?)
  - gvdiffsplit: useful but is it a full-blown difftool?
  - :G commit to make commiting "an interactive process"
  vimcasts 31-35
  - Use more extensively! :Git blame, diff, etc.

Document more: quit vs close

- Toggle GitGutter?

Python LSP and stuff:
https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#jedi_language_server
  - :PlugInstall
  - :Mason
  - select jedi-language-server
    - Press i
  - Profit???

  + linters
  + formatters

Also: treesitter is probably a good thing?
https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter
Maybe even snippets?? LuaSnip? - see nvim-cmp for extras!
Other plugins: Ferret, Ultisnips, SuperTab


Is ryanoasis/vim-devicons really required?

- lspsaga?
- lspkind?
- https://github.com/onsails/diaglist.nvim

nvim-cmp provides documentation previews or what?
is coc.nvim better than nvim-cmp though?
  - e.g. does that show some details about the completion list menu item?
Some even nicer menus?
https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/wiki/Menu-Appearance
SuperTab is mentioned here!
  https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/wiki/Menu-Appearance

Document, learn more, reorganize, recomment new stuff!


:G diff should show current buffer?

Use :confirm?
