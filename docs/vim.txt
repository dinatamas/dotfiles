======

Initial setup:

  - [Install vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#unix-linux
  - Install plugins: `:PlugInstall`
  - Install: `sudo pacman -Sy ctags fzf ripgrep git-delta`
  - Install: `pip install pynvim`

Sometimes issue `:PlugUpgrade` and `:PlugUpdate` to keep things up-to-date.
To clean older packages use `:PlugClean`.

Custom keybindings:

  - Leader: space
  - Command prefix: .
  - Escape (insert mode): Ctrl+e
  - Toggle wrapping: <leader>w
  - Clear highlights: Ctrl+h

Navigation workflow:

  - Avoid using windows and tabs.
    - Move between windows: Ctrl+arrow.
  - Ctrl+n to open the file explorer.
    - Press / to fuzzy find files.
  - Switch files: <leader>f to fuzzy find and preview files.
  - Switch buffers: <leader>b to fuzzy find and preview buffers.
  - <leader>g to recursively grep for a string.
  - <leader>d to exit current buffer.
  - <leader>D to exit a buffer by number.

Plugins:

  The plugin manager I use is vim-plug.

  Gitgutter:
    - Show git diff markers next to the lines.
    - Jump between changes: [c and ]c
    - Preview/stage/undo hunks: ;hp and ;hs and ;hu
    - Load all changes to the quickfix list: :GitGutterQuickFix
    - Fold all non-changed lines: :GitGutterFold
    TODOs:
      - Work with untracked (new and non-ignored) files!
      - Find an alternative that can also handle unstaging hunks?
      - Add and customize key mappings.
      - GitGutterGetHunkSummary() in status line?
      - Interacts well with vimdiff - so learn & improve that!
      - https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter#cycle-through-hunks-in-all-buffers
      - Customize the colors of added/modified/removed lines!

  Gruvbox:
    - Nice colorscheme.

  Lualine:
    - Powerline-like statusline.
    TODOs:
      - Add new functions from other plugins as components.
      - Configure other plugins as extensions.
      - diagnostics: should use nvim_lsp?
      - Match the colorscheme to the tmux scheme.

  NerdTree:
    - A file tree explorer. Press ? for help.
    - Toggle: Ctrl+n
    Plugins:
      - git: Add git symbol support.
      - syntax highlight: Add file type icons.
    TODOs:
      - Make the two plugins look nice together!

  Tabline:
    - Powerline-like tabline which also shows buffers.

  Tagbar:
    - A file structure explorer. Press ? for help.
    - Toggle: Ctrl+t
    TODOs:
      - https://github.com/preservim/tagbar/wiki
      - More configuration?
      - https://github.com/dinatamas/dotfiles/blob/5d9dcce4b06fa68d60bf5618985930999be7ccc2/config/nvim/init.vim

  vim-devicons:
    - Nice icons that other plugins use.

  vim-fish:
    - Syntax highlight support for fish scripts.

TODOs:
  - Plugins: fugitive?
  - Ugly TODO black highlight?
  - Unneeded? autocmd!, syntax on, filetype plugin indent on
  - au BufNewFile,BufRead *.txt set txt required? And for other fish/md/latex?
  - Quicker keybindings for editing/navigating/closing buffers, tabs.
  - Prompt for closing if there are more than one buffers?
  - Unify every plugin where file / git modified etc. status symbols are present.
  - Show only ephemeral windows! Like quick fixes? OR improve window navigation.
  - Would be cool to know how to select non-following lines visually.
    - Then this will be much more useful:

  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21140409/vim-warn-if-file-is-not-tracked-in-git
  - Incorrect color scheme - wrong colors?
  - TODO: change buffer prev/next to something p/n?
